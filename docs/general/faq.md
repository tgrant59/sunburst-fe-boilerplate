## Where are the files coming from when I run `npm start`?

In development Webpack compiles your application runs it in-memory. Only when
you run `npm run build` will it write to disk and preserve your bundled
application across computer restarts.

## How do I fix `Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3000`?

This simply means that there's another process already listening on port 3000.
The fix is to kill the process and rerun `npm start`.

1. Find the process id (PID):
    ```Shell
    ps aux | grep node
    ```
    > This will return the PID as the value following your username:
    > ```Shell
    > janedoe    29811  49.1  2.1  3394936 356956 s004  S+    4:45pm   2:40.07 node server
    > ```
    > Note: If nothing is listed, you can try `lsof -i tcp:3000` 

1. Then run
    ```Shell
    kill -9 YOUR_PID
    ```
    > e.g. given the output from the example above, `YOUR_PID` is `29811`, hence
    that would mean you would run `kill -9 29811`

## Issue with local caching when running in production mode (F5 / ctrl+F5 / cmd+r weird behavior)

Your production site isn't working? You update the code and nothing changes? It drives you insane?

#### Quick fix on your local browser:

To fix it on your local browser, just do the following. (Suited when you're testing the production mode locally)

`Chrome dev tools > Application > Clear Storage > Clear site data` *(Chrome)*

## Local webfonts not working for development

In development mode CSS sourcemaps require that styling is loaded by blob://,
resulting in browsers resolving font files relative to the main document.

A way to use local webfonts in development mode is to add an absolute
output.publicPath in webpack.dev.babel.js, with protocol.

```javascript
// webpack.dev.babel.js

output: {
  publicPath: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/',
  /* â€¦ */
},
```

## Non-route containers

> Note: Container will always be nested somewhere below a route. Even if there's dozens of components
in between, somewhere up the tree will be route. (maybe only "/", but still a route)

### Where do I put the reducer?

While you can include the reducer statically in `reducers.js`, we don't recommend this as you lose
the benefits of code splitting. Instead, add it as a _composed reducer_. This means that you
pass actions onward to a second reducer from a lower-level route reducer like so:


```JS
// Main route reducer

function myReducerOfRoute(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SOME_OTHER_ACTION:
      return someOtherReducer(state, action);
  }
}
```

That way, you still get the code splitting at route level, but avoid having a static `combineReducers`
call that includes all of them by default.
